# Energy-Chan Streams
As the prototype of Auxilary Neural Engine slowly moves towards completion and the stream/launch date is getting closer, this repository was created. This repository contains all stream videos and logs produced by Energy-Chan, the prototype character test, during stream.

## Streaming Schedule
The first stream (YT) is planned to be somewhere in January 2025. This may be pushed back depending on development of the model. I intend to stream biweekly, subject to my availability. If there is a busy week or month, there may not be a stream.

### Content of Streams
The stream is estimated to follow this breakdown:
- 30 minutes of implementation/work
- 20 minutes of testing
- 10 minutes of just driving the model around with life (random content like a clash of clans attack, a CS lecture, a MLBB match, etc)

As the model progresses, it is likely that the implementation time decreases and the model driving time increases.

## FAQ
### Where to find the streams?
I will update this repo with a link sometime later.

### What is the different between this model and other current-day AI Youtube content such as Vedal & Neuro?
The difference is that Energy-Chan is primarily a research prototype that has entertainment as a **metric**. In addition, there are a few components of Energy-Chan not found in Neuro, such as 3D-spatial movement and the **memory engine (HLGraphRAG)** used for high performance recall.

### Code for AXNE?
Unfortunately, I have opted not to disclose the code for Auxilary Neural Engine. Energy-Chan is essentially proprietary, albeit this may change in the next few years or so.
