# Energy-Chan & AXNE (ATHR Labs)
As the prototype of Auxilary Neural Engine slowly moves towards completion and the stream/launch date is getting closer, this repository was created. This repository contains all stream videos and logs produced by Energy-Chan, the prototype character test, during stream, as well as written papers.

## About
Energy-Chan serves as the front and testing metric for ATHR Lab's AXNE. ATHR holds core 6 principles for all human-recreation models.

### Performance Testing
We establish hard coded metrics to **ensure** our model is improving. These are tests/benchmarks custom designed, used on previous models and models from other vendors. Youtube is one of Energy-Chan's metrics, providing ATHR with access to feedback/reviews.

### Memory
Our model must be able to store and retrieve data in a human-like manner. To do this, we developed a complex system HLGraphRAG, inspired by Microsoft's GraphRAG, using weighted retrival graphs, allowing for high performance recall.

### Movement
Our model is capable of moving, conducting actions such as waving a hand when they want to or conducting executions on a computer.

### Real-time model & World
Our model is capable of keeping track of a world, having real-time updates to its information to make the best and personalized choices with low response times.

### AGI
With every event/stream, our model gains new knowledge from the world and learns something new. Improving its score on tests is expected, intuition is not.

### Reinforcement
The model has low rates of erroneous data. It's output matches the personality of the character, and it makes sense in a real world context.

## Streaming Schedule
The first stream (YT) is planned to be somewhere in February (delayed) 2025. This may be pushed back depending on development of the model. I intend to stream biweekly, subject to my availability. If there is a busy week or month, there may not be a stream.

### Content of Streams
The stream is estimated to follow this breakdown:
- 30 minutes of implementation/work
- 20 minutes of testing
- 10 minutes of just driving the model around with life (random content like a clash of clans attack, a CS lecture, a MLBB match, etc)

As the model progresses, it is likely that the implementation time decreases and the model driving time increases.

## FAQ
### Where to find the streams?
I will update this repo with a link sometime later.

### What is the different between this model and other current-day AI Youtube content such as Vedal & Neuro?
The difference is that Energy-Chan is primarily a research prototype that has entertainment as a **metric**. In addition, there are a few components of Energy-Chan not found in Neuro, such as 3D-spatial movement and the **memory engine (HLGraphRAG)** used for high performance recall.

### Code for AXNE?
Unfortunately, I have opted not to disclose the code for Auxilary Neural Engine. Energy-Chan is essentially proprietary, albeit this may change in the next few years or so.
